FIJI (ImageJ) code for quantifying foliar fungal disease severity on leaves

Code was written for analyzing the percent leaf area damaged of Elymus virginicus (Ev) and Microstegium vimineum (Mv). The steps include isolating the leaf from a blue background and measuring leaf area, isolating brown lesions from the leaf and measuring area, and for Mv, isolating and measuring the area of green space in the middle of lesions. The output of the code includes measurements and images with overlays of the areas isolated.
